STAGE 3 — SO-005 Conflict + AI Reschedule [1:00 – 1:30]
---------------------------------------------------------
SAY:
"Now the critical test from the challenge."
"SmartHome IoT just escalated SO-005 from P3 to P1."
"A naive priority-first approach would push SO-003 — AgriBot, deadline March 4 — one day late."
"Let's ask the AI to handle it."
DO:
Tap "Comment" button.
Type: "SO-005 was escalated to P1. Accommodate the priority change but keep SO-003 on time — it has a confirmed deployment window."
SHOW:
"Comment received"
"Requesting revised schedule..."
AI returns new schedule.
SAY:
"The agent sends a structured JSON input to Gemini — all orders with deadlines, production times, and the user's feedback."
"Gemini returns a structured JSON reorder plus a comment explaining its reasoning."
SHOW:
New schedule is visible with AI comment.
SO-003 remains on time.
SO-005 moved up as far as safely possible.
SAY:

DO:
Tap into a production order detail.
SHOW:
Video stream link for the digital twin.
Digital twin footage (or screenshot of it running).
SAY:
"A separate computer vision node monitors this stream for defects and sends real-time events to the agent."
SHOW:
Bot notification: "Defect detected in batch — 1 of 3 items failed"
SAY:
"A defect was caught."
"The bot gives us two options: restart the batch and push later orders back, or cancel and move everything forward."
DO:
Choose restart.
Schedule updates.
Two orders now show as late.
SHOW:
Updated schedule with late orders highlighted.
SAY:
"Two orders will now miss their deadlines."
"We tap 'Notify Clients' — the agent composes personalized delay emails per customer through the Arke API and sends them."
DO:
Tap "Notify Clients" button.
SHOW:
Email notification summary in Telegram.
Shows customers notified and delay amounts.
SAY:
"End-to-end: read orders, schedule, approve, detect defects from the physical world, reschedule, notify stakeholders."
"All through one Telegram agent."

SO-005 was escalated P3 -> P1.
A naive priority-first plan can schedule SO-005 before SO-003 and miss SO-003 by a day.
An EDF-correct plan keeps SO-003 first (tighter deadline) and can still meet both.
